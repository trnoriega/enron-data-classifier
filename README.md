# Analysis of Enron Data
## Based on Udacity intro to machine learning course

### Goal

The goal of this analysis is to use publicly available data from the investigation into the [2001 Enron scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) to develop a machine learning algorithm that could identify persons of interest (referred to as "pois") with precision and recall  >0.3. 

The full outline of the process can be found in the [summary](summary.ipynb) notebook
